Soju-Scraper is a webscraping program to webscrape details and images from  [MyDramaList](https://www.mydramalist.com) website. 
Since there is no public API for this website, this project was made to webscrape directly from the website.

## Prerequisites

In order to run this program it is recommended to have at least **Python 3.6 or above**.

Also make sure that the following modules are installed:

- requests
- BeautifulSoup4
- Pillow
- tkscrolledframe

To install them at once, run:

``` pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pillow tkscrolledframe```


## Features
Along with a CLI interface (Coming Soon) it mainly has a easy-to-use GUI. It includes:

### Soju-Scraper
The main program used to display the info of any K-Drama along with the poster of it.
The UI is pretty simple and easy to use.
It displays **Name, Native Title, Popularity, Episodes, Airing Date, Synopsis and Cast** of the searched drama.

Also it has a feature to show the **Top-100, Upcoming and Latest K-Dramas**.

And the **About** button pops up a window which shows a little praise for me ;)

### Soju Downloader
Soju-Downloader is the program to download all the images of a drama from the MDL website.

It gets the image links and downloads them one-by-one and saves them in the same directory as of the program.

It does the same job as Soju Downloader except, it has a GUI interface.


## Why Soju-Scraper?
'Coz why not! ðŸ˜†

I made this project for my personal use and to develop my skills in **Tkinter** and **BeautifulSoup4**.
As of future updates, I am thinking of creating a library for webscraping MyDramaList.
